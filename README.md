Project Goal: Determine whether clinical data can predict if a patient will suffer from Heart Failure

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

Dataset contains the following columns:
1.	Age – Patient Age 
2.	Sex – Patient Sex
a.	F – Female
b.	M – Male
3.	ChestPainType:
a.	ASY – Asymptomatic
b.	ATA – Atypical Angina
c.	NAP – Non-Anginal Pain
d.	TA – Typical Angina
4.	RestingBP – Patient blood pressure at rest
5.	Cholesterol – Patient cholesterol
6.	FastingBS – Patient blood sugar when fasting
7.	RestingECG – Patient’s electrocardiogram reading
8.	MAXHR – Patient’s highest heart rate reading
9.	ExcerciseAngina – Determines whether Patient experiences angina from exercise
a.	Y – Yes
b.	N – No
10.	Oldpeak – Patients with an oldpeak = ST; ST reading determines abnormality on an ECG.
11.	ST_Slope – determines incremental heart-rate shifts, usually excercise-induced
a.	Down – downsloping
b.	Flat – no slope
c.	Up – upsloping
12.	HeartDisease – Determines whether patient has heart disease
a.	1 – patient has heart disease
b.	0 – patient does not have heart disease
