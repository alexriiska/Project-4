## Project Goal: 

By implementing multiple maching learning models, we aim to determine whether patients' heart failure can be predicted by clinical cardiovascular diseases data. 

## Dataset: 

**Data Source:**  
> [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)  
csv file: [heart.csv](Resources/heart.csv)  

<br>

**Columns:**  
| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Age` | Patient Age |
| `Sex` | Patient Sex; F - Female, M - Male |
| `ChestPainType` | ASY – Asymptomatic, ATA – Atypical Angina, NAP – Non-Anginal Pain, TA – Typical Angina   |
| `RestingBP` | Patient blood pressure at rest |
| `Cholesterol` | Patient cholesterol level |
| `FastingBS` | Patient blood sugar when fasting |
| `RestingECG` | Patient’s electrocardiogram reading |
| `MAXHR` | Patient’s highest heart rate reading |
| `ExcersiseAngina` | Determines whether Patient experiences angina from exercise; Y - Yes, N - No |
| `Oldpeak` | Patients with an oldpeak = ST; ST reading determines abnormality on an ECG. |
| `ST_Slope` | Determines incremental heart-rate shifts, usually excercise-induced; Down – downsloping, Flat – no slope, Up – upsloping |
| `Heartdisease` | Determines whether patient has heart disease; 1 – patient has heart disease, 0 – patient does not have heart disease |

## Data Preparation and Modeling


Pre-procression Step: 
ETL – Clean data, column X was removed, load into, dropped irrelevant columns
Scaling –
